### Aim of this course

Through this course's homework, you will develop the needle(necessary elements of deep learning) library.

AlexNet, AlphaGO, StyleGAN to generate fake people faces.
These are all famous example of deep learning applications.

More recent examples:

GPT-3 of OpenAI (2021), that can generate text.
#RNN [[RNN笔记]] 

AlphaFold 2 (Jumper 2021, DeepMind). It can predict **the 3D structure of proteins from DNA sequence**

 These works are all done essentially at companies(big ones or one with great resources).

What can one or a small group do to incluence this?

### Not just for the "big players"

### Working on deep learning ten years ago.

2012, Tianqi Chen want to write a ConvNet using GPU. It took him six months to do the work, which is about 44k lines of code.

Now you only need 10 lines of code for only a few hours.

 ### Reason #1: To build deep learning system 

Despite the domainance of deep learning libraries and TensorFlow and PyTorch.

The playing field in this space is still fluid. 不稳定

比如 JAX

You can build your own framework or enchance existing frameworks.

### Reason #2: To use existing systems more effectively

 Understanding how these systems are working underneath the hood so as to use them more effectively.

For example, if you want to build a non-standard layer.

### Reason #3: Fun
